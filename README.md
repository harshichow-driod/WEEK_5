# Week 05 â€“ IO Programming & Advanced Java Concepts

This repository contains assignments and practice examples from **Week 05** of the Java Backend program.

## Overview
This week focuses on advanced input/output programming in Java, including handling CSV and JSON data formats, as well as Java annotations and reflection. These concepts are crucial for building robust, maintainable backend applications that deal with data processing and runtime metadata inspection.

## Topics Covered
- **CSV Data Handling:** Reading, writing, parsing, and validation of CSV files  
- **JSON Data:** Reading, writing, parsing JSON data, and schema validation  
- **Annotations & Reflection:** Built-in and custom annotations, annotation processing, and reflection in Java  
- **Design Principles:** Overview and real-world use cases of annotations and reflection  

## Prerequisites
- A computer with a supported operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)  
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed  
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, or Eclipse  

## How to Use This Repository
This repository is structured to reflect the topics covered each day. You can find code examples, notes, or exercises within the respective daily folders (if available). Feel free to explore the code, run it, and modify it to deepen your understanding.

## Best Practices
- Efficient handling of file input/output with resource management  
- Robust data validation during CSV and JSON processing  
- Use of Java annotations to enhance code readability and maintainability  
- Leveraging reflection responsibly to inspect and manipulate classes at runtime  
- Writing clean, well-documented, and modular code for easy maintenance
